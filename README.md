# Oven-Knob

At the coffee shop I used to work at, our top oven knob broke clean off. Without the top oven, we couldn't efficiently 
bake our bacon, sausage, pork roll, biscuits, scons, and cookies. I measurd the D-shaped stem on the oven control panel, 
modeled a knob in Solidworks, printed it, and it fit perfectly (picture pending). While it's designed for an M-3 threaded 
bolt to secure to the flat side of the D, it ended up melting slightly over time and securely fused itself to the stem.
